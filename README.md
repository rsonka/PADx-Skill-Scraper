"# PADx-Skill-Scraper" 

NOTE: README is much more legible in RAW form...should be a button for that if you click on the README file above.


This program helps organize the hunt for skillups for monsters in Puzzle and Dragons.
It has two main capabilities:

1. listMySkillInfo <inputFile> <outputFile> [-dteS] 

    Takes a file <inputFile> with lines beginning with monsternums, and
    possibly other things after the monsternum. Lists skillup monsters and 
    skillup dungeons for that monster in <outputFile> (may be same file. 
    Will also preserve lines beginning with #.), by scraping PADX. 
    If dteS is included, does not include dungeons with names that contain any of 
    the words listed in the dungeonsToExclude setting under 
    PADskillGetterSettings.txt.  Example usage:
       listMySkillInfo monsters.txt monsters.txt -dteS
	   
2. checkForTempSkillups <skillInfoInputFile> <outputFile> [-cteS]

    Takes a file <skillInfoInputFile> that was generated by listMySkillInfo.
    Scrapes PADX to see if any of the dungeons listed as non-normal and 
	non-technical skillup dungeons in that file are currently available 
	in the 'special' or the 'coin' sections, and saves its findings to 
	<outputFile>. If -cteS is included, does not report dungeons in 
	the 'coin' section that are listed in the alwaysInCoin setting in 
    PADskillGetterSettings.txt. Example usage:
       checkForTempSkillups monsters.txt availableToday.txt -cteS
	   


------------------------------------------ DISCLAIMERS and more Usage Notes

IMPORTANT NOTES

1. the file PADskillGetterSettings.txt MUST be in the same directory as the program
 if you want to use the optional dungeon-excludes form the menu.
 
2. If you do not have python, Windows users can run the program using padxSkillGetter.exe under the dist folder.

DISCLAIMERS:

big disclaimer:
This program is only as smart as the website it scrapes from, PADx. 
If PADx doesn't know, or formats it really weirdly, the program doesn't know.
For example, if PADx starts categorizing technical dungeons as 'multiplayer dungeons', that is where they will show up. 

--Does not handle Japanese characters well yet. 
--Right now does not check if your monster changes skill on evolution. Assumes you want skillups for that skill.
--Only reports the name of the dungeon the monster drops from, not which specific level(s) of the dungeon it drops from.
--Only considers monsters "farmable" if they drop from a dungeon. Gungho collab PEM is not considered farmable here.
--Does NOT document monsters that evolve into monsters that skill up your monsters. 
   (This was problematic with padx, and you usually don't want to do that anyway, because it's miserably time-consuming.).
   
   
NOTE:
   Because of how padx uses template pages, program needs to know what page numbers are too high to be real:
   If pad ever gets over 100,000 monsters, the templateNumber variable below needs to be made higher.

   
   

------------------------------------------ Optional: Python interpreter use

If you can run in a python interpreter, you can enter quit on the menu and then directly call the two main functions:

listMySkillInfo(cardNumList, dungeonsToExclude)
and 
checkForAvailableSkillups(normallyExcluded, alwaysInCoin, fullCardReportStr)

------------------------------------------ listMySkillInfo(cardNumList, dungeonsToExclude):

cardNumList = Python list of numbers of the mosnters you're interested in skilling up. E.g. [[1, 2, 3, 3000].

dungeonsToExclude = Python list of words. It will ignore any dungeon that has one of these words in its name.
	Suggested: dToE, which is ["Challenge", "Tournament"]
	
This function will output a tab-delimited list of information. I usually view it in microsoft excel. 

Example use:

>> listMySkillInfo([1330, 1336], dToE)

(Program runs, outputting some debugging info so you know it's doing something...)
Eventual output: 

Number	Name	farmableSkillUps	Normal or Technical dungeons	Other dungeons
1330	Krishna	Flame Insect Dragon, Flammesickle	.	Herme Descended!, Fire Insect Dragon, Wood Guardian Dragon
1336	Ganesha	Entrepreneur, Lex Luthor && Genius Scientist, Lex Luthor	.	Batman vs Superman Collab

Saving that to a string in Python and typing print myString.replace("\t", "\n") will split each thing up onto lines. E.g.:

>>> myString = """Number	Name	farmableSkillUps	Normal or Technical dungeons	Other dungeons
1330	Krishna	Flame Insect Dragon, Flammesickle	.	Herme Descended!, Fire Insect Dragon, Wood Guardian Dragon
1336	Ganesha	Entrepreneur, Lex Luthor && Genius Scientist, Lex Luthor	.	Batman vs Superman Collab"""

>>> print myString.replace("\n", '\n-----\n').replace("\t", "\n")

------------------------------------------ checkForAvailableSkillups(normallyExcluded, alwaysInCoin, fullCardReportStr)

normallyExcluded = what you put on dungeonsToExclude when making the cardReport. 
	Not relevant yet, but eventually may check if any of those kinds of dungeons are available.
	
alwaysInCoin = list of coin dungeons that you don't want to be told about (presumably because they're always there.).
	A global variable named "alwaysInCoin" lists the level-up mechanics dungeons.
	
fullCardReportString = Python string containing the cardReport you got as output of listMySkillInfo. 
	Will ignore all lines that don't begin with a number, so feel free to annotate it.
	
This function reports what cards in your cardReport have farmable skillups from the current "special" or "coin"
dungeons, again tab-delimited.

Example use: (remember "myString" from above?):

>>> checkForAvailableSkillups(dToE, alwaysInCoin, myString) 

CardNum	CardName	DungeonsAvailable
1330	Krishna	Fire Insect Dragon

[This was run 10/3/2017. Your results will vary with what dungeons are currently available!]
